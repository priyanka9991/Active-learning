Abstract:  
Preclinical drug screening experiments for anti-cancer drug discovery typically involve testing candidate drugs against cancer cell lines. This process can be expensive and time consuming since the possible experimental space can be quite huge, involving all of the combinations of candidate cell lines and drugs. Guiding drug screening experiments with active learning strategies could potentially identify promising candidates for successful experimentation. This study investigates various active learning strategies for selecting experiments to generate response data for identifying effective treatments and improving the performance of drug response prediction models. We have demonstrated that most active learning strategies are more efficient than random selection for identifying effective treatments.
